        <p id="artistText">
          Sometimes I doze off and wake up just to find myself in the form of a geometric bird.
          Nothing cool, just a plain o'l birdie.
          Flying is cool and all til you realize you still can't escape from the wrath of assignments though. <br> <br>
          ...But, wait. Why does my stress manifest itself in these strange forms?

        <h3>CSS-grid/Flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            I chose to use CSS-grid when making the layout for my website.
            This is because I prefer the flexibility the CSS-grid's two dimensional layout provides compared to flexbox which is primarily designed for a one dimensional layout.
            In addition, CSS-grid was built with responsiveness in mind, so I found it easier to manipulate my layout the way I wanted with this technology.
            My CSS-grid is set up so that each div in the wrapper takes up a certain fraction of the page.
            I found this to be the best way to use CSS-grid, as I could choose how may fractions horizontally and vertically I wanted each div to span.
            Thus when you make the browser window smaller, all the grid-elements will adapt to the change accordingly.
          </p>

        <h3>Canvas/SVG</h3>
          <p>
            I used Canvas and SVG to make a bird composed of several geometrical shapes.
            The bird itself is static, but you can interact with it so that it changes color upon hovering.
            In addition I implemented an functions for an animation which can be toggled on/off by clicking on a button.
            In both Canvas and SVG, I made functions for generating particles (small circles) of random size and color.
            The particles are meant to appear on random positions within the Canvas/SVG element.
            The particles are thought to be a disruptive element that complements the idea behind the "confused bird" and the "stressed bird". <br><br>
            I chose to code the picture to be as similar as possible in both Canvas and SVG, but made the interactive effects slightly different from each other.
            This was done purposefully to get a different impresssion from each picture, even though the picture itself is the same.
          </p>

        <h3>JQuery</h3>
          <p>
            I have used the Jquery-library from Google's CDN.
            In my assignment, I have mainly used JQuery to implement different types of interactivity in my Canvas and SVG element.
            This includes the ability to change color of elements upon hovering, and being able to toggle the animations on/off.
            I found this to be done fairly easily with the help of Jquery as opposed to writing it in regular javascript, as these actions only required a few lines of code.
            I also used JQuery to hide/show my documentation by clicking on a button.
          </p>

        <h3>Cross-Browser Testing</h3>
          <p>I conducted cross-browser testing on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
            I tested and made sure that the layout would be similar on both browsers when the browser window was normal, and when I made the browser window smaller.
            I read that Jquery is cross-browser compatible, so I assumed that my on-hover function and animation would behave similarly in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
            To make sure, I also conducted test to show that the navigation and animation functioned in a similar manner - which it did.
          </p>

        <h3>Useful sources</h3>
         <p>
           In this project, I found W3school.com, developer.mozilla.org to be great sources of information for learning more about Canvas, SVG and JQuery.
           In addition, I went on stackoverflow.com for advice when I encountered more specific problems related to my code.
